Stuff from mac os X fuzz paper,,,Fuzzing results?
expr,"Code from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/
Tests in coreutils-8.9/tests/misc/
Clearly some tests for expr
Not sure how to run them yet",GNU coreutils,Seems robust
groff,"Code from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/groff/
No obvious tests",FSF,
zic,"Code from http://web.mit.edu/freebsd/head/contrib/tzcode/zic/
(maybe not best source)
No obvious tests",Glibc?,
zsh,"Code from http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh/files/zsh-dev/4.3.17/
Has 39 tests that we can run",,Possible hanging?
as,"Code from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/
Some tests in binutils-2.23/binutils/testsuite
Not clear how to run any of the tests",From GNU binutils,Seems robust
Indent,Already set up for genprog,,fuzzing successful
nroff,"http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/doctools.html
No obvious tests",GNU,
ditroff/troff,"http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/doctools.html
No obvious tests",GNU,
ul,"Code from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/
No apparent tests for ul (there are some for other utils)",BSD,Seems robust
vi(ex)/vim,"Has test cases, should be easy to set up in genprog",http://vim.org,"ptyjig not working, skipping for now"

Thing with exploits,,,
